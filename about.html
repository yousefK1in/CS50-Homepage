        <h3>Hello, I’m Yousef Abara</h3>
        <p>
            I’m 18 years old and from Syria. Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by electronics, PCs, and computer science. But because of the war, I never had the chance to fully explore or develop my talents in these fields. I lacked the time, the resources, and the stability that such learning requires.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that the war is over, I can finally start chasing my passion and learning the things I love. I currently study Computer Science at the Syrian Virtual University, which is especially convenient for me because it’s time-flexible — I can attend lectures whenever it suits me instead of being tied to fixed schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the university, I’m also studying from other sources, such as CS50, which I’ve found to be a well-rounded course with excellent teachers and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this stage in my life, I don’t have a fixed plan for the future, but I have ambitions. My main goal is to keep learning, improving, and building the skills that will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the field of technology.
        </p>
