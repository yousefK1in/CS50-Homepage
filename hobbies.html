        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <div>
            <h2>Computer Science Software</h2>
            <p>I really love Computer Science it’s my favorite hobby. I enjoy programming and solving problems,
                and it’s something I never get bored of. I like the challenge of figuring things out and the
                excitement when the code finally works. It’s not just about building programs for me, it’s also
                about learning new ways of thinking and pushing myself to improve. I will work hard day and night to make
                this hobby an actual career.

            <h2>Computer Science Hardware</h2>
            <p>Apart from the software side, I really enjoy the hardware side of things. I’m fascinated by how
                transistors form logic gates and different modules, and how they translate electricity into
                instructions and useful, complex programs. Even though I can only explore this hobby virtually
                and can’t build actual circuits from transistors, I still love learning about it. Understanding
                how everything works under the hood gives me a deeper appreciation for the technology I use every day.

            <h2>Electrical engineering</h2>
            <p>I’m not an electrical engineer, nor do I study it, but I really enjoy electronics and i love
                working with them. I like learning how electricity works and try to fix broken things. I have
                a little experience with a soldering iron, but that’s about as far as it goes. Even so,
                I mostly work on personal stuff i try to fix them or improve them, and
                it’s always fun and satisfying to figure out how things operate and bring them back to life.

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>I’m not really sure if gaming counts as a hobby anymore, but I really enjoy it in my free time.
                I play all sorts of games and don’t mind trying new ones. I used to spend a lot of time on
                competitive online games, but they are very challenging and time-consuming, so I rarely play
                them now. Most of my gaming time is spent on single-player story games, which I find relaxing
                and enjoyable, especially when the story is well-written and deep. It’s a great way for me to
                unwind and get immersed in a different world for a while.
